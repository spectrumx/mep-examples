## MEP 3D Models

These models are designed to be 3d printable upgrades to the standard MEP build. 
All have been tested in PETG and may require supports to print. 

### MEP Bulkhead Switch

This is a replacement for a bulkhead connector and adds a mounting point
for a 12 mm switch. The hole is slightly under-sized so a threaded 12mm
switch will thread directly in to the print. 

The following switches have been confirmed to fit:

To use as a power switch for the MEP, wire the switch between PIN 3 (Remote)
on the  Traco DC/DC converter and the power return (V-) on the input side. When
shorted to ground the remote input disables the converter and will power off
everything on the 12V power rail. 

### MEP Bulkhead Switch with Cable Channel

This is similar to the prior model, except it also includes a channel to pass
through DC wiring. This can be used to power external fans or other 12V devices.
Sealant will be required to weatherproof the channel, since a gap will remain
when the wiring is in place. 

### MEP Bulkhead Switch Nut

This is the matching nut for the two prior bulkhead fittings.
